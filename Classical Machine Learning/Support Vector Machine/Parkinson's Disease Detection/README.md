Machine Learning model that detects if a person has Parkinson's disease from given data.

Dataset used : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikasukani/parkinsons-disease-data-set

This is a classification problem, we predict whether the person has parkinson's disease or not.

Steps:

1. Check for any null values in the dataset
2. Split the input and output column in the dataset.
3. Split the data into training and testing data.
4. Use Standard Scaler to change the range of the values between -1 and 1.
5. Train and test the SVM model with the training data and testing data.
